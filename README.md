Local development containers for myself.

## Description
This is local development containers for myself using docker-compose. The web server port is 8080 and the phpmyadmin port is 8000.  
This is the first time we have made such a thing, so I think there may be some mistakes, but please understand.

## Demo
build_docker-compose hoge$ docker-compose build  
build_docker-compose hoge$ docker-compose up -d  
build_docker-compose hoge$ ./init.sh
